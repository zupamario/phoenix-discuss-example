# Discuss

Original project is available here:
https://github.com/StephenGrider/ElixirCode

I followed the Udemy course "The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp" where the "Discuss" application is developed.
The course develops the app using Phoenix 1.2 which is very outdated.
I updated the dependencies and code to be compatible with the latest version of Phoenix (1.6.5 at this time).
There are also some minor improvements to the code.

More features will be added to this application to turn it into an even better example of Phoenix capabilities.

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
